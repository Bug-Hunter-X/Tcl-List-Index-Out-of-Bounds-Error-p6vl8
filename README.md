This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl when accessing elements of a list using an index that is out of bounds.  The `bug.tcl` file contains code that incorrectly handles list indices, leading to an error when attempting to access an element beyond the list's boundaries.  The `bugSolution.tcl` file shows a corrected version that addresses this issue by explicitly checking the index bounds before accessing the list element.
